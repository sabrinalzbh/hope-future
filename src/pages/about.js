               Hey there!
               So glad you stopped by. Let me share some of me, with you. 
               My name is Sabrina. I live in Cleveland, Ohio with my 3 young boys, my youngest being 10!
               (I don't feel old at all!) Lol. 
               I've been on my developer journey for over 2 years now, WOW! I can't believe how much time has gone by.
               I completed my Full-Stack Dev certificate and a bit after completed a course for CompTIA Security+. Yes,
               I am aiming to work in cybersecurity as a Pentester, eventually. :) 
               While that is a future goal of mine, I also desire to have a side gig building websites for others. But, 
               here's the thing; I am not planning to just "build websites", but moreso to bring visions and dreams to life. 
               My greatest desire is parnter with the vision of a project that it would leave the mark intended, not just for persnal gain,
               but for relational gain.   </p>
